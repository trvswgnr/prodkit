and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- No entries yet.

## [0.1.63] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Added lifecycle regression coverage proving `withTimeout` does not settle
  `run()` until async `withRelease` cleanup and async `.on("exit")` finalizers
  finish.

### Fixed

- Fixed `withTimeout` structured-cancellation semantics so timeout now waits for
  aborted branch unwind/finalizers before returning `Err(TimeoutError)`, while
  keeping timeout result precedence on the timeout path.
- Fixed lifecycle exit-context arg propagation so `ExitContext.args` now reflects
  runtime inputs for deferred/finalizer cleanup in both direct arity runs and
  nested parameterized `yield*` composition.

## [0.1.62] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Updated repository references from `trvswgnr/op` to `trvswgnr/prodkit` after the monorepo rename.

## [0.1.61] - 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Renamed the monorepo quality script from `pnpm run check` to `pnpm run gate`.

## [0.1.58] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Changed `Op.try` `onError` mapper handling to pure normalization
  (`E | Promise<E>`). Returned `Op`/generator values are no longer executed;
  they are now treated as the `Err` value directly.
- Migrated the project to a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo layout
  (`packages/op`, `examples/op`, `benchmarks/op`, `tools/op`) so
  installs, task orchestration, and CI checks run from one workspace graph with
  a single lockfile.
- Adapted the existing tag-based release process to the monorepo structure by
  updating CI/release workflows and release automation to run through pnpm
  filters while keeping the current non-Changesets publish flow.
- Updated contributor and user-facing docs to reflect the new workspace paths
  and pnpm-based commands.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Op.try` to await async `onError` mappers before emitting `Err`, so
  rejection mapping no longer leaks a raw `Promise` into the error channel and
  downstream tagged-error matching remains type- and runtime-consistent.
- Fixed consumer smoke validation to run in an isolated temporary examples
  workspace, preventing package-install smoke checks from mutating or clobbering
  workspace-linked dependencies.

## [0.1.57] - 2026-05-07

### Changed

- Unified operation typing around the exported `Op` contract across builders,
  combinators, policies, and runtime internals, so public helper inference now
  consistently reflects the same type surface users compose against.

## [0.1.55] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Fixed `yield*` interop for generic helpers returning `Op(function* () {})` in raw TypeScript execution by ensuring callable op wrappers expose an iterator path, so nullary helpers now compose without surfacing `Err(UnhandledException)`.
- Fixed `Op.any` tuple inference so infallible branches collapse the error channel to `never` instead of exposing an impossible `ErrorGroup`.
- Fixed `Op.all` type inference to stop injecting `UnhandledException` into declared error unions when no operation can produce it.

## [0.1.54] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Added `src/test-utils.ts` to centralize shared integration-test helpers
  (`deferred`, abort-listener tracking, async timing helpers, and invalid
  concurrency fixtures) so new test files can reuse one source of truth.
- Added an `enter` lifecycle hook (`.on("enter", ...)`) so runs can attach
  setup side effects at run start without threading setup through call sites;
  enter/exit contexts now also expose runtime `args` for arity ops, with
  documented behavior and integration/type coverage.
- Added focused `core` runtime unit coverage for `drive` internals (signal
  handoff, instruction validation, finalizer LIFO ordering, and cleanup-fault
  precedence), plus direct tests for internal helper/type-guard behavior.
- Added `DESIGN.md` documenting execution invariants (cleanup ordering, error
  precedence, and combinator chain-order guarantees) with direct links to
  representative runtime paths and tests to reduce semantic drift risk.
- Added a dedicated `benchmarks/` harness with baseline comparisons against
  latest `main` (default) or latest npm release, covering runtime overhead
  scenarios plus minified/gzip bundle-size deltas.

### Changed

- Extracted default nullary lifecycle hook wiring into a shared helper and
  reused it across builders, combinators, policies, and core nullary operators
  to remove repetitive hook plumbing without changing runtime behavior.
- Fixed `tap`, `tapErr`, and `recover` so callbacks that return `Op(function* () {})`
  are now executed instead of being treated as plain values, closing a runtime
  type-soundness hole where failures could be silently dropped or function objects
  could leak as successful results.
- Documented the cooperative cancellation contract in `README.md`, including
  explicit runtime guarantees, caller responsibilities, and a composed
  `Op.all(...).withTimeout(...).withSignal(...)` wiring example.
- Locked `Op.any`/`Op.race` loser semantics so aborted branches now finish
  cleanup/finalizers before `run()` returns, while preserving first-settler
  result precedence to keep outcome behavior stable.
- Added inline concurrency-contract comments for combinator drivers and policy
  signal/timeout helpers so contributors can reason about abort propagation,
  cleanup timing, and settle precedence without rediscovering edge cases.
- Clarified contributor testing governance with an explicit two-tier strategy in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, including unit vs integration scope boundaries and a
  no-duplication decision rule for placing assertions.
- Added contributor benchmark guidance in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a dedicated
  `benchmarks/README.md` playbook, while keeping README benchmark docs minimal.
- Consolidated compile-time API contracts into a dedicated `src/types.test.ts`
  file and removed scattered `expectTypeOf` assertions from runtime behavior
  tests so type regressions can be audited in one place.
- Strengthened algebraic correctness checks by replacing fixed-case monad law
  assertions with property-based tests and adding randomized `Result` algebra
  coverage for `map` and `andThen` composition laws.
- Simplified nullary operator policy wiring to derive retry/timeout/signal behavior
  from `inner`/`rebuild` config in `makeNullaryOp`, reducing per-operator boilerplate
  while preserving push-through vs wrap-self semantics (including timeout widening
  edge cases for `mapErr`, `tapErr`, `recover`, and `onExit`).
- Collapsed arity-level operator wrappers into a generic lifting path so fluent
  `map`/`mapErr`/`flatMap`/`tap`/`tapErr`/`recover` on parameterized ops reuse
  shared policy plumbing while preserving timeout and lifecycle behavior.

## [0.1.53] - 2026-05-02

### Changed

- Hardened release cut automation so changelog promotion is formatted before
  validation checks run.
- Kept release behavior consistent when `Unreleased` is empty by generating a
  minimal release note automatically.
- Consolidated release scripts so cuts promote changelog entries, bump version,
  and tag in one flow.
- Aligned CONTRIBUTING release guidance with the automated cut path.
- Captured and validated intermediate release-candidate behavior that
  previously failed changelog/version gating.

## [0.1.50] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added a release guard that requires a changelog heading matching the current
  package version before publish steps run.

## [0.1.49] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Added the first project changelog and captured the pre-changelog release
  history to establish a stable baseline for future release notes.

## [0.1.1 - 0.1.48] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- Established the core `Op` model with typed `Result` outcomes, generator-first
  composition, and fluent operation chaining.
- Added policy primitives and composition APIs, including retry, timeout,
  signal-aware execution, and core combinators (`all`, `allSettled`, `any`,
  `race`).
- Added lifecycle and cleanup capabilities across operation runs, including
  release/finalizer hooks and generator-scoped deferred cleanup.
- Expanded examples and smoke coverage for realistic consumer install paths.

### Changed

- Evolved API naming and ergonomics over time (for example `Op.pure` -> `Op.of`,
  `suspend` -> `Op.try`, and lifecycle hook API updates) to improve clarity and
  consistency.
- Standardized outcomes on `better-result` and aligned public re-exports around
  explicit API surface decisions.
- Reworked internal architecture to reduce wiring drift, centralize fluent op
  construction, and improve maintainability of core execution paths.
- Strengthened type safety and typing clarity, including cast policy guidance,
  tighter inference behavior, and explicit handling of unavoidable TypeScript
  limitations.
- Hardened release, CI, and smoke workflows around trusted publishing and
  consumer-style verification.

### Fixed

- Improved cleanup and cancellation reliability across error, timeout, and abort
  paths, including generator finalization behavior.
- Tightened combinator and policy behavior in edge cases (listener teardown,
  retry timing, and composed operation semantics).
- Improved examples and parsing validation in places where earlier behavior
  could produce weaker diagnostics or drift from production expectations.
