# @prodkit/op

A runtime-agnostic, composable, and predictable library for writing operations in TypeScript, built on top of [`better-result`](https://github.com/dmmulroy/better-result).

This README documents the `@prodkit/op` package API and usage.
For monorepo/workspace orientation, see the repo root [`README.md`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/README.md).
For tradeoffs against Effect, neverthrow, `fp-ts`, native `Promise`, and `ResultAsync`, see
[`COMPARISON.md`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/packages/op/COMPARISON.md).
For runtime overhead ratios, throughput figures, and bundle size, see
[`PERFORMANCE.md`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/packages/op/PERFORMANCE.md).

> [!WARNING]
> This library is currently in alpha. The API will almost certainly change between releases while it stabilizes.

Write code that stays readable as it grows and keep predictable
behavior in production. Compose steps top-to-bottom, apply retry, timeout, and cancellation as
policy, and run parallel work without scattering reliability logic across your app.

## Why this exists

Async TypeScript has two huge flaws: you can't see from a function's type what it might fail with, and the standard concurrency helpers happily let sibling tasks keep running after one of them blows up. `@prodkit/op` fixes both. It builds on `better-result`'s `Result` model, generator composition, and typed error inference, then adds an async runtime with suspend/resume semantics, structured resource cleanup, cancellation-aware concurrency, and composable retry/timeout policies on top. Concurrency combinators thread cancellation through every child, so when one fails the rest actually stop instead of burning quota in the background. Retry, timeout, and external cancellation attach through `.with(Policy.*)` before `.run()`. Minimal runtime dependencies, a small footprint, and an API that's easy to learn and use.

## Installation

```bash
npm i @prodkit/op
```

Runtime support for consumers: any JavaScript runtime with `Promise` and `AbortController`.
For Node consumers specifically, this package is tested on Node `24.14.0` (24.x Active LTS, the
current LTS line). CI also runs
packed-package smoke checks on Bun `1.3.13`, Deno `2.7.14`, and a Cloudflare Workers-like
Miniflare environment.

This project is designed to be runtime-agnostic: no Node-specific APIs are required by the public
operation model.

CI publishes a Vitest coverage artifact for this package. The test suite includes unit,
integration, type-level, and property-based law checks, plus separate packed-package smoke checks
for Node, Bun, Deno, and a Cloudflare Workers-like runtime.

## Dependencies (`better-result`)

`@prodkit/op` is built on [`better-result`](https://github.com/dmmulroy/better-result) for typed
outcomes, tagged domain errors, and the runtime `UnhandledException` channel. The package declares
`better-result` as a peer dependency so your app installs one copy and TypeScript resolves the
same `Result` types that `.run()` returns.

### Peer dependency range

```json
"better-result": "^2.9.0"
```

Install it alongside `@prodkit/op`. If your package manager does not install peers automatically,
run `npm i better-result` explicitly.

**Compatibility:** releases in the current alpha series target `better-result` 2.x versions that
satisfy `^2.9.0`. Patch and minor updates within that range should stay compatible with the symbols
prodkit uses in public types and runtime behavior. A future `better-result` major would require a
matching `@prodkit/op` release that updates the peer range before you upgrade.

### Public API surface

Most `better-result` symbols are part of prodkit's public contract but are **not** re-exported from
the `@prodkit/op` package entry. Import them from `better-result` in application code; import
operation APIs from `@prodkit/op`.

From **`better-result`** (recommended import path):

- `Result` -- return type of `.run()` and `Op.run()`; also appears on `ExitContext.result`, `Op.settle`,
  and `Op.allSettled`
- `TaggedError` -- factory for typed domain errors (`yield* new MyError()`)
- `UnhandledException` -- normalized failure channel; always included on `.run()` error unions
- `TaggedErrorInstance` -- instance typing for tagged errors
- `Err`, `Ok`, `InferErr` -- optional advanced result typing (not re-exported from `@prodkit/op`)

From **`@prodkit/op`**:

- `TimeoutError` -- built-in timeout failure from `.with(Policy.timeout(...))`; uses the same
  `TaggedError` pattern as domain errors from `better-result`
- `ErrorGroup` -- aggregate error from `Op.any` when every branch fails (prodkit-specific, not from
  `better-result`)

No other `better-result` exports are published from `@prodkit/op` today.

## Subpath exports

Op-native extensions ship as separate subpath exports on `@prodkit/op`. Import them explicitly; the
main `@prodkit/op` entry does not re-export them ([ADR 0008](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/docs/adr/0008-op-subpath-exports.md)).

### `@prodkit/op/di`

Dependency injection for composed ops: tokens, `inject`, `provide`, and scoped/singleton bindings.

```ts
import { Op } from "@prodkit/op";
import { DI } from "@prodkit/op/di";

class DatabaseDependency extends DI.Dependency("Database")<Database> {}

const getUser = Op(function* (id: number) {
  const db = yield* DI.inject(DatabaseDependency);
  return yield* db.findById(id);
});

const runnable = DI.provide(getUser, DI.singleton(DatabaseDependency, db));
const result = await runnable.run(1);
```

Public exports: `DI`, `Dependency`, `inject`, `provide`, `scoped`, `singleton`, and helper types
(`InferArgs`, `InferErr`, `InferOk`, `InferReqs`).

Runnable consumer examples live under
[`examples/op/di/`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/examples/op/di/) (onboarding,
scoped cancellation, HTTP handler with pool checkout).

### `@prodkit/op/policy`

Policy constructors and retry delay helpers. The main `@prodkit/op` entry owns execution mechanics;
the policy subpath only builds values passed to `.with(...)`.

```ts
import { Op } from "@prodkit/op";
import { Delay } from "@prodkit/op/policy";
import * as Policy from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const policy = {
  attempts: 3,
  when: (cause: unknown) => cause instanceof Error,
  delay: Delay.exponential({ baseMs: 100, maxMs: 1_000, jitter: 0.5 }),
};

const result = await Op.try(() => fetch("https://example.com"))
  .with(Policy.retry(policy))
  .with(Policy.timeout(1_000))
  .run();
```

Public exports: `retry`, `timeout`, `cancel`, `release`, `Delay`, `define`, `RetryPolicy`,
`RetryDelay`, `ExponentialDelayOptions`, policy attachment types, and generic HKT helpers
re-exported from `@prodkit/op/hkt`.

### `@prodkit/op/hkt`

Reusable higher-kinded type encoding for modules that need an open type-level transform.
Policy uses it to let custom `.with(...)` attachments describe how they transform `Op<T, E, A, M>`
without adding overloads to core.

```ts
import { HKT_RESULT, type Apply, type HKT, type HKTArg } from "@prodkit/op/hkt";

type ToRecordResult<Self> = {
  readonly value: HKTArg<Self, 0>;
};

interface ToRecord extends HKT {
  readonly [HKT_RESULT]: ToRecordResult<this>;
}

type Applied = Apply<ToRecord, readonly [number]>;
//   ^? { readonly value: number }
```

Public exports: `HKT_ARGS`, `HKT_RESULT`, `HKT`, `HKTArg`, and `Apply`.

## Quick start

```ts
import { Op } from "@prodkit/op";
import { TaggedError } from "better-result";

class DivisionByZeroError extends TaggedError("DivisionByZeroError")() {}

const divide = Op(function* (a: number, b: number) {
  if (b === 0) return yield* new DivisionByZeroError();
  return a / b;
});

const sqrt = Op(function* (n: number) {
  // any value can be passed to Op.fail, but it should be discriminative
  if (n < 0) return yield* Op.fail("Negative");
  return Math.sqrt(n);
});

const program = Op(function* () {
  const quotient = yield* divide(10, 2);
  const rooted = yield* sqrt(quotient);
  return rooted * 2;
});

// Nullary generator-built ops can compose directly. Parameterized ops are invoked first.
const startup = Op(function* () {
  return "ready";
});
const composed = Op(function* () {
  return yield* startup;
});

const result = await program.run();
//    ^? Result<number, DivisionByZeroError | "Negative" | UnhandledException>
if (result.isOk()) {
  console.log(result.value);
} else {
  console.error(result.error);
}
```

## Core API

### `Op(fn)`

Turns a generator into a composable operation.
Inside the generator, `yield*` another op to unwrap success or short-circuit on failure.
Parameterized ops must be invoked before composition: use `yield* loadUser(id)`, not
`yield* loadUser`.

### `Op.of(value)`

Creates an op that succeeds with `value`.
If `value` is a promise, it is awaited and converted into the same `Result` model.

### `Op.fail(error)`

Creates an op that always fails with `error`.

### `Op.defer(finalize)`

Registers cleanup for the **current** op run inside a generator. **`finalize(ctx)`** receives **`ExitContext`**:
the run `AbortSignal`, runtime **`args`**, plus **`result`**: the operation's pre-finalizer settlement result (from `better-result`, so use `.isOk()` / `.isErr()` as usual).

Deferred callbacks share one stack
with `.with(Policy.release(...))` / `.on("exit", ...)`: they run in **LIFO** order when the run unwinds (success, typed
failure, `UnhandledException`, timeout, or external cancellation). **All** scheduled finalizers run;
even if one throws, the **remaining** callbacks in the stack **still run**. If a single finalizer throws, `.run()` returns
`Err(UnhandledException)` with `cause` set to that fault. If **multiple** finalizers throw, `cause`
is a nested **`Error` chain**: the outer error matches the **first** failure during teardown
(last-registered callback runs first, so it fails first; read the chain outer-to-inner that way); each
`.cause` is the next fault in unwind order. Only **throwing** callbacks appear in the chain: cleanups that finish
without throwing add no links. `finalize` can
be sync or async.

Use `Op.defer`/`.with(Policy.release(...))`/`.on("exit", ...)` for effectful cleanup. Native generator
`finally` blocks are only best-effort synchronous finalization; yielded or async work inside
`finally` is not driven during early exit.

`Policy.release` invokes only `release(successValue)` (no context parameter); its stack slot is invoked with the
same **`ExitContext`** as other finalizers for this run, but the release function ignores it.

Use this for step-local teardown that reads better than attaching release policy to every producer,
or for "always run" cleanup before a risky step.

```ts
const runQuery = Op(function* () {
  const conn = yield* acquireConnection;
  yield* Op.defer(() => conn.release());

  return yield* getActiveUsers(conn);
});
```

```ts
const risky = Op(function* () {
  yield* Op.defer(() => invalidateTempFiles());
  return yield* commitTransaction();
});
```

`Op.defer` is only meaningful inside an `Op(function* () { ... })` body (compose with `yield*`).
For releasing the **success value** of a single op, `.with(Policy.release(...))` on that op is often clearer.
For lifecycle hooks at op boundaries, `.on("enter", fn)` runs setup when a wrapper starts and
`.on("exit", fn)` runs teardown when the run unwinds.

### `Op.sleep(ms)`

Creates an op that waits for `ms` milliseconds and then succeeds with `void`.
Negative durations are normalized to `0`. Non-finite durations fail at run time with
`UnhandledException`.

`Op.sleep` observes surrounding cancellation policy. If a run is cancelled by
`.with(Policy.cancel(...))`, `.with(Policy.timeout(...))`, or a combinator abort while sleeping,
the sleep stops early and the run surfaces the cancellation through the normal
`UnhandledException` channel.

```ts
const poll = Op(function* () {
  while (true) {
    const job = yield* loadJob;
    if (job.ready) return job;
    yield* Op.sleep(250);
  }
});
```

### `Op.try(f, onError?)`

Runs an async or sync function and converts failures into `Err`.
If `onError` is omitted, failures become `UnhandledException`.
`onError` returns the error value `Op.try` should emit (or a `Promise` of that value). If it
returns an `Op`/generator object, `Op.try` treats that object as the error value and does not run
it.

`f` receives an `AbortSignal` tied to surrounding cancellation policy (`Policy.timeout`,
`Policy.cancel`, and combinator cancellation). Forward it to cancellable APIs so in-flight work
(e.g. `fetch`, DB queries) actually stops instead of leaking after a timeout.

```ts
import * as Policy from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const fetchUser = Op.try((signal) => fetch("/api/users/1", { signal }));
const result = await fetchUser.with(Policy.timeout(1000)).run();
// when the 1s budget elapses, the fetch is aborted.
```

```ts
const mapped = await Op.try(
  () => Promise.reject("boom"),
  (cause) => `mapped: ${String(cause)}`,
).run();
// Result<never, "mapped: boom" | UnhandledException>
```

### `Op.run(op, ...args)`

Static runner for ops. This is equivalent to `op.run(...args)`, and is useful when you want to
execute an op value passed around as data.
`Op.run(op, ...args)` does not expose a cancel handle; if the caller needs external cancellation, compose
the op with `.with(Policy.cancel(signal))` before running it.

```ts
const result = await Op.run(Op.of(7));

const add = Op(function* (a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
});
const sum = await Op.run(add, 2, 5);
```

### `Op.empty`

Reusable no-op that succeeds with `void`.

```ts
const result = await Op.empty.run();
```

### `.run(...args)`

Executes the operation and returns `Result<T, E | UnhandledException>` from `better-result`.

```ts
const result = await op.run(...args);
if (result.isOk()) {
  console.log(result.value);
} else {
  console.error(result.error);
}
```

### `.map(f)`

Transforms an op's success value while preserving the same error channel and argument list.
Use this when you want a one-step value transformation without writing a generator.

```ts
const userId = Op.of({ id: 69, name: "Marissa" }).map((user) => user.id);
const result = await userId.run(); // Result<number, UnhandledException>
```

### `.flatMap(f)`

Chains to the next op using the previous success value. This is the monadic bind operation:
the next op only runs after the first one succeeds, and both error channels are preserved.

```ts
const getUserTodos = getUser(69).flatMap((user) => getTodos(user.id));
const result = await getUserTodos.run();
```

### `.tap(f)`

Observes a successful value without changing it. This is useful for logging, metrics, tracing,
or debugging in the middle of a pipeline without restructuring into a generator.

If `f` returns a plain value, that value is ignored and the original success value passes through.
If `f` returns a bound nullary `Op`, that op is sequenced and its result is discarded. Invoke
generator-built ops before returning them from `f`. If `f` throws, or if the returned op fails, that
failure propagates.

```ts
const withLog = Op.try(() => fetch("https://example.com/user/69"))
  .tap((response) => {
    console.log("status", response.status);
  })
  .map((response) => response.status);
```

### `.tapErr(f)`

Observes typed failures without changing which error is returned. This is useful for error metrics,
structured logging, and alert hooks while preserving existing control flow.

If `f` returns a plain value, that value is ignored and the original typed error passes through.
If `f` returns a bound nullary `Op`, that op is sequenced and its result is discarded. Invoke
generator-built ops before returning them from `f`. If `f` throws, or if the returned op fails, that
failure propagates. `UnhandledException` bypasses `tapErr`.

```ts
const withErrorMetric = Op.try(
  () => fetch("https://example.com/user/69"),
  (cause) => new FetchError({ cause }),
).tapErr((error) => {
  console.error("user lookup failed", error.message);
});
```

### `.mapErr(f)`

Transforms an op's typed error channel while preserving the success value and argument list.
Use this when you want to normalize or enrich domain failures without restructuring into a
generator.

`UnhandledException` is part of the runtime channel and bypasses `mapErr`; only tracked typed
errors are passed to `f`.

```ts
const normalizeFetchError = Op.try(
  () => fetch("https://example.com/user/69"),
  (cause) => new FetchError({ cause }),
).mapErr((e) => (FetchError.is(e) ? new UserLookupError({ cause: e }) : e));
```

### `.recover(predicate, handler)`

Recovers from selected typed failures while preserving the rest of the error channel.
Pass a type predicate such as `MyError.is` or `(error): error is MyError => MyError.is(error)`.
`handler` can return either a fallback value or another bound nullary `Op`. Invoke generator-built
ops before returning them from `handler`.

`UnhandledException` is intentionally not recoverable through this method; unexpected throws
still surface so bugs are not silently converted into success paths.

```ts
class NotFoundError extends TaggedError("NotFoundError")() {}
class PermissionError extends TaggedError("PermissionError")() {}

const lookup = Op(function* (id: string) {
  if (id === "missing") return yield* new NotFoundError();
  if (id === "forbidden") return yield* new PermissionError();
  return { id };
}).recover(NotFoundError.is, () => ({ id: "fallback" }));

// lookup: Op<{ id: string }, PermissionError, [string]>
```

### `.with(policy)`

Attaches retry, timeout, external cancellation, or success-value release policy to an operation. Built-in policy values
come from `@prodkit/op/policy`.

```ts
import * as Policy from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const policy = {
  attempts: 3,
  when: (cause: unknown) => cause instanceof Error,
  delay: (attempt: number) => attempt * 100,
};

const fetchWithRetry = Op.try(() => fetch("https://example.com")).with(Policy.retry(policy));
```

`Policy.retry(policy?)` wraps an operation with retries. `Policy.timeout(timeoutMs)` wraps an
operation with a timeout and fails with `TimeoutError` when the wrapped operation does not finish
before `timeoutMs`. `Policy.cancel(signal)` binds an operation to an external `AbortSignal` so you
can cancel in-flight work, for example when an HTTP request is aborted or a job is shut down.
`Policy.release(release)` registers success-gated release logic for the wrapped operation's
successful value. Library authors can also pass custom policies built with `Policy.define(...)`
when they need a reusable wrapper that preserves the operation API while adding behavior such as
short-circuiting, metering, or domain-specific failure handling.

Composition order determines semantics:

```ts
// timeout applies to the ENTIRE retried run
const totalBudget = Op.try(() => fetch("https://example.com"))
  .with(Policy.retry(policy))
  .with(Policy.timeout(5000));

// timeout applies to EACH attempt
const perAttempt = Op.try(() => fetch("https://example.com"))
  .with(Policy.timeout(5000))
  .with(Policy.retry(policy));
```

```ts
const controller = new AbortController();
const fetchUser = Op.try((signal) => fetch("/api/users/1", { signal })).with(
  Policy.cancel(controller.signal),
);

const runPromise = fetchUser.run();
controller.abort(new Error("request cancelled"));
const result = await runPromise;
```

### Cooperative cancellation contract

Cancellation is cooperative, not preemptive. `@prodkit/op` guarantees that it raises abort
signals at the right points, but your operation code must observe those signals for work to
stop quickly.

Runtime guarantees:

- `.with(Policy.timeout(...))`, `.with(Policy.cancel(...))`, and short-circuiting combinators
  (`Op.all`, `Op.any`, `Op.race`) propagate abort through `AbortSignal`.
- `Op.sleep(ms)` observes abort signals and stops waiting early when its enclosing run is cancelled.
- When a combinator decides its final result early, in-flight siblings are aborted and the
  combinator waits for them to settle before returning.
- Scheduled teardown still runs (`Op.defer`, `.with(Policy.release(...))`, `.on("exit", ...)`) even when a run
  ends via timeout or external abort.

Caller responsibilities:

- Build side-effecting work with `Op.try((signal) => ...)` and pass `signal` to cancellable APIs
  (`fetch`, DB clients, queue clients, etc.).
- Keep composed child ops signal-aware so branch-level cancellation in combinators can stop
  downstream IO.
- Treat cancellation as a stop request: if an underlying dependency ignores `AbortSignal`, that
  dependency can continue running after the op settles.

Recommended composed-run wiring:

```ts
import * as Policy from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const controller = new AbortController();

const fetchJson = (url: string) =>
  Op.try(async (signal) => {
    const res = await fetch(url, { signal });
    return res.json();
  });

const loadDashboard = Op.all([
  fetchJson("/api/users/1"),
  fetchJson("/api/alerts"),
  fetchJson("/api/settings"),
])
  .with(Policy.timeout(1_500))
  .with(Policy.cancel(controller.signal));

const runPromise = loadDashboard.run();

// for example: HTTP disconnect, worker shutdown, or route transition
controller.abort(new Error("caller aborted dashboard load"));

const result = await runPromise;
```

### `.with(Policy.release(release))`

Registers resource release logic that runs after a successful resource-producing step settles.

```ts
import * as Policy from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const runQuery = Op(function* () {
  const conn = yield* acquireDbConnection.with(Policy.release((conn) => conn.release()));
  return yield* getActiveUsers(conn);
});

const result = await runQuery.with(Policy.timeout(1000)).run();
// conn.release() runs even if the run times out or is externally aborted.
```

`release` can be sync or async. `Policy.release` only schedules `release` after the wrapped op
**succeeds**, so a failing inner op does not call `release`. If `release` throws, the run fails
with `UnhandledException` and `cause` set to that fault (other registered finalizers **still run**
afterward in LIFO order; multiple faults become a **nested `Error.cause` chain**, same as `Op.defer`).

### `.on("exit", finalize)`

Registers unconditional finalization when the enclosing run settles (success or failure), on the same LIFO stack as `Op.defer` and `.with(Policy.release(...))`. **`finalize(ctx)`** receives **`ExitContext`** with run `args` and the pre-finalizer **`ctx.result`**. If `finalize` throws, `.run()` fails with `UnhandledException` and `cause` set to that fault (or a nested **`error.cause` chain** if several finalizers fault).

```ts
const result = await doWork.on("exit", (ctx) => telemetry.record(ctx)).run();
```

### `.on("enter", initialize)`

Registers run-start initialization before the wrapped op body is driven. `initialize(ctx)`
receives `EnterContext` with the run `signal` and runtime `args`.

```ts
const result = await doWork
  .on("enter", ({ signal, args }) =>
    telemetry.startSpan({ aborted: signal.aborted, key: String(args[0]) }),
  )
  .on("exit", (ctx) => telemetry.finishSpan({ args: ctx.args, result: ctx.result }))
  .run();
```

Ordering/composition rules:

- Enter handlers run in wrapper order (last chained runs first).
- Exit handlers keep the current unwind ordering.
- Enter handlers run once per wrapper run; retry attempts happen inside that wrapper regardless
  of whether `.with(Policy.retry(...))` is chained before or after `.on("enter", fn)`.

## Typed errors

Use `TaggedError("Name")` for discriminated domain errors that still behave like real `Error` objects.
You can fail with one directly with `yield* new MyError()` inside an op.

```ts
import { Op } from "@prodkit/op";
import { TaggedError } from "better-result";

class ValidationError extends TaggedError("ValidationError")<{
  field: string;
}>() {}

const validate = Op(function* (name: string) {
  if (name.trim().length === 0) {
    yield* new ValidationError({ field: "name", message: "Name is required" });
  }
  return name;
});
```

## Retry defaults

`.with(Policy.retry())` with no policy uses:

- `attempts: 3`
- `when: () => true`
- exponential backoff from `1000ms` up to `30000ms` with full jitter (`1.0`)

You can also build your own delay function with `Delay.fixed(ms)` or
`Delay.exponential({ baseMs, maxMs, jitter })`.
`Delay.defaultRetry` is the pre-built delay function used by the default retry policy.

```ts
import { Delay } from "@prodkit/op/policy";

const policy = {
  attempts: 5,
  when: (cause: unknown) => cause instanceof Error,
  delay: Delay.exponential({ baseMs: 200, maxMs: 2_000, jitter: 0.5 }),
};
```

## Built-in errors

- `UnhandledException`: default wrapper when a thrown/rejected value is not mapped to a domain error.
- `TimeoutError`: produced by `.with(Policy.timeout(timeoutMs))` when the budget expires.
- `ErrorGroup`: produced by `Op.any` when all children fail.
- **Teardown chains:** if several of `Op.defer`, `.with(Policy.release(...))`, or `.on("exit", ...)` callbacks throw in one run, `UnhandledException.cause` may be an `Error` whose `.cause` links onward (**first failure in LIFO execution order is the outermost message**).

## Concurrent combinators

Run multiple ops concurrently and compose them back into one `Op`.
When a result is decided early (`all` after a failure, `any` after a success, `race` on first
settle), remaining work is cancelled through `AbortSignal`.

### `Op.all(ops, concurrency?)`

Runs ops concurrently and succeeds with a tuple of their success values. Fails fast on the first
failure; in-flight siblings receive an abort and the combinator waits for them to settle before
returning. Empty input succeeds with `[]`.

Pass a positive integer `concurrency` to cap how many children run at once. Without it, every child
starts immediately. With a cap, `Op.all` stops launching queued children after the first failure.

```ts
const r = await Op.all([Op.of(1), Op.of("two"), Op.of(true)]).run();
if (r.isOk()) {
  const [n, s, b] = r.value; // [number, string, boolean]
}

const bounded = await Op.all(fetchOps, 5).run(); // at most 5 active children
```

### `Op.allSettled(ops, concurrency?)`

Waits for every op and returns a tuple of their `Result`s in input order. For valid inputs it does
not fail and does not short-circuit siblings on child failure.

Pass a positive integer `concurrency` to cap how many children run at once. Unlike `Op.all`,
`Op.allSettled` keeps launching queued children after failures so every input gets a `Result`.
If `concurrency` is not a positive integer, the run fails with `UnhandledException`.

```ts
const r = await Op.allSettled([Op.of(1), Op.fail("nope")]).run();
if (r.isOk()) {
  const [a, b] = r.value; // Result<number, ...>, Result<never, "nope" | ...>
}
```

### `Op.settle(op)`

Runs one op and returns its settled `Result` as a success value. This never fails, which makes it
useful for optional/best-effort reads where fallback logic should continue in the same generator.

```ts
const loadPolicy = Op(function* () {
  const settled = yield* Op.settle(loadPolicyVersion);
  return settled.isOk() ? settled.value : "unknown";
});
```

### `Op.any(ops)`

Succeeds with the first op to succeed; remaining siblings are aborted. If every op fails,
the combinator fails with `ErrorGroup` whose `errors` array holds each child failure
in input index order. Empty input fails with an empty `ErrorGroup` and the message
`"Op.any requires at least one operation"`.

```ts
import { ErrorGroup } from "@prodkit/op";

const r = await Op.any([Op.fail("a"), Op.of(69)]).run();
if (r.isOk()) console.log(r.value); // 69
if (r.isErr() && r.error instanceof ErrorGroup) console.log(r.error.errors);
```

### `Op.race(ops)`

Propagates whichever op settles first: success or failure. Remaining siblings are
aborted with no library-specific reason. `Op.race([])` fails fast with
`UnhandledException`.

```ts
const r = await Op.race([slow, fast]).run();
```

## Webhook consumer example

See the repository example at
[`examples/op/webhook.ts`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/examples/op/webhook.ts)
for a complete order webhook pipeline
that demonstrates:

- input validation with typed domain errors
- idempotency checks
- risk scoring with provider fallback via `Op.any`
- cache/config policy lookup via `Op.race`
- concurrent inventory/payment orchestration via `Op.all`
- best-effort side effects via `Op.allSettled`
- retry + timeout budgets with `.with(Policy.retry(...))` and `.with(Policy.timeout(...))`
- abort propagation into in-flight calls through `AbortSignal`

Run the consumer-level checks (repo contributors, from monorepo root):

```bash
pnpm --filter @prodkit/tools run examples:smoke:pack
```

Run all cross-runtime smoke checks for Bun, Deno, and a Cloudflare Workers-like runtime
when both `bun` and `deno` are on `PATH`:

```bash
pnpm --filter @prodkit/tools run runtime:smoke
```

You can also run one runtime at a time with `runtime:smoke:bun`, `runtime:smoke:deno`,
or `runtime:smoke:edge`.

## Performance

`@prodkit/op` adds measurable runtime overhead compared with raw `Promise` usage in
microbenchmarks. Real applications are usually dominated by I/O, so relative overhead matters
less once network or database latency is in the picture.

See [`PERFORMANCE.md`](https://github.com/trvswgnr/prodkit/blob/main/packages/op/PERFORMANCE.md)
for the latest snapshot from the benchmark harness, including all paired scenarios, ops/sec
figures, slowdown ratios, and bundle size.
